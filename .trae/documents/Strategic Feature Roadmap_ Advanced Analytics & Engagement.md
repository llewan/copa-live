Based on the research into market leaders like FotMob, OneFootball, and SofaScore, I have identified several innovative features that would significantly enhance the comprehensiveness of your app.

Here is a proposed roadmap to implement these features, categorized by impact:

## Phase 1: Deep Match Intelligence (Data & Analytics)
*Focus: Moving beyond "what happened" to "how it happened".*
1.  **Attack Momentum Graph**: Implement a visual chart showing which team is dominating pressure minute-by-minute.
2.  **Head-to-Head (H2H) Analysis**: Add a pre-match section showing historical results, recent form (W-D-L), and average goals between the two teams.
3.  **Advanced Player Stats**: Expand match details to include player ratings, heatmaps (if data available), and granular stats (key passes, duels won).

## Phase 2: Fan Engagement & Gamification
*Focus: Keeping users active before and during the match.*
1.  **Match Predictions**: A feature allowing users to predict scores before kickoff and see community consensus.
2.  **Live Fan Polls**: "Who will win?" and "Man of the Match" voting widgets.
3.  **Live Chat/Comments**: A discussion section for each live match.

## Phase 3: Utility & Ecosystem
*Focus: Making the app a daily utility.*
1.  **"Where to Watch"**: Integration of TV channel/streaming listings for matches.
2.  **Calendar Sync**: "Add to Calendar" button for upcoming fixtures.
3.  **Transfer Market Hub**: A dedicated news feed for transfers and rumors.

**Recommended Immediate Next Step:**
I recommend starting with **Phase 1 (Deep Match Intelligence)** as it leverages your existing data infrastructure (API-Football) to provide immediate value. Specifically, implementing **H2H Analysis** and **Momentum Graphs** would be high-impact upgrades.

Shall we proceed with designing the **H2H Analysis** and **Momentum Graphs** first?
